ARCHITECTURE & SLIDE CONTENT SUMMARY

1. Data-driven Pester tests using arrays/hashtables for fixtures
2. Centralized Azure queries in DiscoveryPhase.ps1 (BeforeDiscovery event)
3. Fixtures compare expected vs actual cloud state at runtime
4. Use AI (Copilot) to generate fixtures and assertion functions
5. Reporting: Console, Azure DevOps, Xray Jira
6. BDD-style (Describe/It) for test organization
7. Sprint 0 for POC/spikes, iterate with BDD
8. Link Jira issues to test plans, 1 execution per story/issue
9. Do not create bug issues for all test failuresâ€”wait for sprint completion
10. Avoid code repetition, use Git for test code
