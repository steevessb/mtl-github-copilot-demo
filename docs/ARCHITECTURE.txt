AZURE QA AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE

1. DATA-DRIVEN TESTING WITH PESTER
   - Use YAML fixtures (config/AzureFixtures.yml) to define expected resource configurations
   - Leverage PowerShell hashtables and arrays for test fixtures
   - Centralize Azure queries in DiscoveryPhase.ps1 with BeforeDiscovery event
   - Test fixtures compare expected vs actual cloud state at runtime
   - Use wildcards and dynamic replacements for flexible matching

2. AZURE RESOURCE TESTING COMPONENTS
   - Storage Accounts: Validate existence, settings, security, and compliance
   - Resource Groups: Verify tags, locations, and resource locks
   - Security: Validate TLS versions, secure access, encryption, and compliance
   - Network: Test NSG rules, VNETs, and connectivity requirements

3. CI/CD INTEGRATION
   - Azure DevOps Pipeline with AzurePowerShell tasks
   - Secure authentication with service connections or managed identities
   - Staged test execution (unit, integration, compliance)
   - Test result reporting to Azure DevOps and Xray Jira

4. BEST PRACTICES FOR QUALITY ENGINEERS
   - Use BDD-style (Describe/It) for test organization
   - Start with Sprint 0 for POC/spikes, then iterate with BDD
   - Link Jira issues to test plans (1 execution per story/issue)
   - Wait for sprint completion before creating bug issues for test failures
   - Avoid code repetition, use Git for test code
   - Leverage GitHub Copilot for generating test fixtures and assertions

5. AZURE SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IN TESTS
   - Validate HTTPS-only configuration
   - Verify minimum TLS 1.2 enforcement
   - Test for proper encryption at rest and in transit
   - Confirm security defaults are enabled
   - Check for proper Azure AD integration

6. REPORTING OPTIONS
   - Console output for local development
   - NUnit XML for Azure DevOps integration
   - Custom exports for Xray Jira integration
   - Compliance dashboards for security validation
